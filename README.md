- 🤝 Open to collaborating on projects, especially those at the intersection of technology and fitness, where I can blend my professional skills with my personal passions.
- 🏋️‍♂️ Outside of coding, I'm passionate about music and fitness. As a CrossFitter, I love everything about fitness and wellness.
- 💡 I'd love to be a part of any projects related to fitness, leveraging technology to promote health and well-being.
- 📫 Reach out to me here on GitHub or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaron-byrne-aa8b52195/) for collaboration, questions, or just to say hi.

## A Bit More About My Interests

- 🎶 Music is my go-to for relaxation and inspiration, whether playing an instrument or listening to my favorite tracks.
- 🏃‍♂️ Fitness is a big part of my life. I enjoy CrossFit and constantly challenge myself to reach new personal bests.
- 📘 I’m always on the lookout for new learning opportunities, especially those that allow me to merge my tech skills with my interest in fitness.
